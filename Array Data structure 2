#You have a list of your favourite marvel super heros.
#heros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america']
#Using this find out,

#1. Length of the list
#2. Add 'black panther' at the end of this list
#3. You realize that you need to add 'black panther' after 'hulk',
 #  so remove it from the list first and then add it after 'hulk'
#4. Now you don't like thor and hulk because they get angry easily :)
 #  So you want to remove thor and hulk from list and replace them with doctor strange (because he is cool).
  # Do that with one line of code.
#5. Sort the heros list in alphabetical order (Hint. Use dir() functions to list down all functions available in list)
